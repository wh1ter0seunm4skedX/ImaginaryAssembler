# ImaginaryAssembler 🛠️

**ImaginaryAssembler** is a double-pass assembler implemented in C, designed for an imaginary computer architecture. This project was developed as a final assignment for the "System Programming" course at The Open University of Israel.

## 📜 **Overview**
ImaginaryAssembler translates assembly code into machine code using a two-pass approach. It’s a great educational tool for understanding low-level programming and system architecture.

## 🔧 **Features**
- **Double-Pass Assembly:** Efficiently converts assembly code with error-checking across two passes.
- **C Implementation:** Lightweight and portable codebase.
- **Custom Architecture Support:** Tailored for an imaginary computer, allowing unique syntax and commands.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImaginaryAssembler.git
   ```
2. **Compile the Assembler:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o assembler main.c
   ```
3. **Run the Assembler:**
   ```bash
   ./assembler input.asm output.obj
   ```
